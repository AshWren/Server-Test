It teaches a lesson that we can all learn from. If you haven't seen this classic already, I highly recommend it :)\r\n\r\nIn other news, I'll be at Anime Expo this year at tables A/B 37 and 38 with books, posters, and more! See you there! :D",

      "description": "Painted this over Livestream in about 4 hours, you can view the full recording at my new Youtube channel. Thank you very much to all who stayed and watched! I have always loved all imagery of Sherlock Holmes playing the violin, I find it very striking and it's one of his most recognizable and interesting character traits. This piece is inspired by BBC's Sherlock (I cannot possibly recommend this show more!) \r\n\r\nTime-lapsed process video can be watched here. Drawn and painted in Adobe Photoshop with a Wacom tablet. Reference from here.\r\n\r\nAvailable to buy as a phone case and other products here.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT 10/09/13: I have provided this high-res wallpaper as a COURTESY to fellow Sherlock fans, and I expect my work to be treated with respect. Time and time again I have seen art thieves download this painting, PHOTOSHOP OUT MY SIGNATURE, and re-upload it to their own websites as a \"free wallpaper,\" or, even worse, print it as a poster or on a phone case to sell on eBay, Amazon, Etsy, StoreEnvy, etc. It's absolutely ridiculous and disappointing. I'm leaving the wallpaper up because I know most don't do that, but I'm going to say this once again since it's apparently not clear: DO NOT REMOVE MY SIGNATURE FROM THIS ARTWORK FOR ANY REASON . If you see this painting on any of the above sites, please do me a favor and report it. If you see this painting on any products or websites without credit to me, I ask you not to buy it, and JUST REPORT IT. Thank you.\r\n",
